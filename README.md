# GIBSI WEB BACKEND
The GIBSI WEB Backend powers the AI-driven trading core of the GIBSI ecosystem.
It provides RESTful APIs for real-time data handling, model inference, trade signal generation, and backtesting, all optimized for practical AI-based stock trading workflows.

Status: Private repository â€” currently under live testing via
https://crack-akita-brief.ngrok-free.app/

Overview
This backend acts as the central logic layer for GIBSI Striker, connecting the front-end trading interface with AI model pipelines.
